The purpose of this repository is to provide an
example of how to bundle `DataTable` and one of its
extensions (buttons) and to import it dynamically
in the body of an HTML document.

The final document is `package/dist/index.html`.

It is generated with the following commands:

```
cd package
npm install
npm run build
```
